All will remember the day that Rome came to Venice."
 byz_recover_sicily_title: "Subjugate Sicily"

 byz_foothold_in_italy_title: "Italian Foothold"

 byz_recover_jerusalem_desc: "Jerusalem is the holiest site in all Christendom - and we lost it in the seventh century. We can only expunge this shame by recovering it for the empire, restoring the Patriarch to this throne and rededicating its churches to the one true God!"

 byz_recover_west_anatolia_title: "Seize West Anatolia"
